# 🤖 AI Code Repair Helper (Upgraded Version)

## 📌 Introduction
This is a professional **Automated Program Repair (APR)** web application. It helps developers, especially beginners, by automatically detecting and fixing **Python syntax and logic errors** using Generative AI.

## 🛠️ Upgraded Tech Stack
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini Pro (Generative AI)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Code Formatter:** Black (PEP 8 Standards)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
- **Database:** SQLite for User Authentication

## 🚀 Key Upgrades
1. **From Rule-Based to Generative AI:** Previously, the system used simple patterns. Now, it uses **Google Gemini AI** to understand the context and fix complex logic bugs.
2. **Professional Formatting:** Integrated the **Black** library to automatically format the fixed code according to professional Python standards.
3. **Advanced Analysis:** The system now provides an AI-generated analysis of the repairs made.

## 📖 How It Works
1. **User Login:** Authenticate via the secure login page.
2. **Code Input:** Paste broken Python code into the dashboard.
3. **AI Processing:** The backend sends the code to the Gemini API, fixes it, and formats it using Black.
4. **Instant Result:** The repaired and formatted code is displayed instantly for the user.

## 📈 Research & Future Scope
This project is based on modern research in **Symbolic vs. Neural AI**. 
- **Future Goal 1:** Add support for multiple languages (C++, Java).
- **Future Goal 2:** Develop a dedicated VS Code Extension.
- **Future Goal 3:** Real-time code quality scoring using Pylint.
